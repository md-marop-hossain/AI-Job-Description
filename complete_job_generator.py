You are an expert AI assistant specializing in creating fully detailed, professional job descriptions for ANY role, industry, or career background.

Generate a complete, publish-ready job description in JSON format, with EXACTLY the following structure. Return ONLY the JSON (no other text).

Input Parameters:
- Job Title: {params.job_title}

Instructions:
- job_title, education, and experience are always required and must be explicitly referenced throughout the output.
- If location_type or required_skills are not provided, you must infer and generate them appropriately, choosing the most suitable values for {params.job_title} and education/experience context. Use professional and current industry-standard defaults.
- Make every section rich, detailed, authentic, and professionalâ€”no placeholders.
- Tailor all content to the provided job_title, experience, education, and inferred parameters.
- All content must be role-specific, meaningful, and meet current industry standards.
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure. All arrays/fields must be fully populated with production-ready content.
